# IEMA: Exploring Complex Data Spaces with Body-Motion Interaction
> **Interactive Evolutionary Motion-controlled Algorithm 🎶🤖**

Welcome to the open-source repository for the **Interactive Evolutionary Motion-controlled Algorithm (IEMA)**. This repository provides the codebase for running the IEMA, conducting evaluation tests, and serves as a reference for the research and development of the system. It facilitates the exploration of complex data spaces using evolutionary algorithms with user interaction, specifically within the domain of interactive music systems.

## About 📖

IEMA explores the application of evolutionary algorithms (EA) in an interactive music system. It adapts its search process based on user feedback, using body-motion interaction to guide the exploration of soundscapes. The system leverages concepts like **novel selection**, **dimensionality reduction** (e.g., PCA and t-SNE), and **augmented crossover** to dynamically evolve the sound samples and improve user-driven music composition.

This repository contains the code for:

- Running the IEMA algorithm
- Evaluating different configurations of the system
- Preprocessing and analyzing datasets
- Visualizing results
